# Finding-loops-in-a-Graph
This is a project that basically finds out if there is a loop in a graph or not. The graph is not taken as input but random initialization and link is done on the nodes.
# Applications
This is mainly created to find out whether deadlock exists or not. There are several other applications of this code.
